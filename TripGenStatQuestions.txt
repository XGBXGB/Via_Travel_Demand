-if it is possible to derive travel demand without the household surveys and just the cbms data.
>Usual attributes that are used for generating travel demand are:
Househohold income, enrollment/employment (for attraction), car ownership, # of hh members 
>will the model be valid if i trained it using the MUCEP data, and then used it on the cbms data?
>Then, after validation, what if the trend changes? What will be a way to handle this?


-what method to use on attribute selection? Preference? Best practice?

-when will R^2 only be useful, when using RFECV, what can be useful to evaluate the estimator? R^2? Sum of neg squares, etc?

http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#scoring-parameter -> if we use neg_mean_square will that be better than R^2 measure?
-Is RFECV still useful in making a specific model, when I want some attributes fixed, or like when it chooses to not include
an attribute that I want included?
-Should we include the dummy variables during RFECV?

-Is it enough to just count the amenities of different sorts in the zones to know how it affects travel demand?
-Planning to use amenity data, and generate a population estimate based on area and floors

-What's the best way to validate a model like this?
-Also, about sa sinabi dati na hindi masyadong important yung kung gano kaexact yung(coefficients?) kasi hindi naman namin pinoprobe yung relationships?

-Anything that we need to note when forming our polynomial regression model?
